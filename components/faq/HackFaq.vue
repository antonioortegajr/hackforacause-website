    <div class="h4c-bold"><strong>Is there a code of conduct?</strong></div>
    <div>
      Yes, you can find this page

    <div class="h4c-bold">
      <strong>Will the facility be open overnight?</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      Yes. The facility will remain open for hackathon participants though
      the weekend to support the event &#8211; this includes restroom
      facilities. The facility may be open to the general public during
      normal business hours.
    </div>

      <strong
      >I can&#8217;t stay the whole time, can I still
      participate</strong
      >
    </div>
    <div>
      Of course! We realize that a weekend is a long time and people may
      need to attend to other commitments, or just sleep! We do, however,
      strongly encourage you to be present for the first few hours of the
      hackathon to see the idea pitches, as well as the final few hours
      for the presentations and judging. There will also be a special
      prize for anyone who stays until 1am Friday or Saturday night.

    <div class="h4c-bold">
      <strong>Can multiple teams take on the same challenge?</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      Yes! &nbsp;Participating teams may choose whichever “Goldilock”
      challenge strikes their interest. If you or your team is
      particularly skilled, you can also enter multiple challenges.
    </div>
    <div class="h4c-bold"><strong>Can I be a mentor?</strong></div>
    <div>
      At Hack for a Cause industry pros can collaborate directly and
      side-by-side with students. This is different than a collegiate
      hackathon, where mentorship enables professionals to provide only
      light guidance to students.
    </div>
    <div class="h4c-bold">
      <strong>What if I don&#8217;t know how to code?</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      You are still welcome! We have several challenges that don’t require
      any coding skills. As long as you come willing to learn and ready to
      contribute ideas, you can contribute to a team.
    </div>
    <div class="h4c-bold"><strong>What do I bring?</strong></div>
    <div>
      This is a very hands-on and grassroots event. Bring your tools:
      laptops, mobile phones, scratch paper etc. We will provide food,
      drinks, wi-fi, power and all of the other assets specifically noted
      in each of the individual Challenges.
    </div>
    <div class="h4c-bold"><strong>Do I own the code?</strong></div>
    <div>
      Winning project repos will be made public and open sourced under the
      MIT license. &nbsp;You can fork your repo and build anything you
      like including for-profit apps but so can anyone else.
