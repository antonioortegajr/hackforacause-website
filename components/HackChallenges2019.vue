          We believe that with the power of the internet anything is
          possible, which is why we are challenging you (yes, you!) to
          help us change your community and maybe even the whole
          world. It starts with an innovative idea to solve problems
          impacting local organizations; it ends with a hackathon and
          the opportunity to present your finished product to local
          businesses and entrepreneurs who can then, in turn,
          revolutionize with these new tools.
          <br >
          + Transformation for the public good, powered by fiber and
          you.
