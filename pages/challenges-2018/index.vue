        <p>
          Eugene-Springfield was recently chosen for inclusion to the
          US Ignite Smart Gigabit Community. In addition, we are proud
          to announce that his year’s Hack for a Cause has been
          selected as an official US Ignite Smart Gigabit Community
          Reverse Pitch. This additional designation provides a
          national partnership and funding to help our community
          further innovation and push the limits of gigabit internet
          infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Smart Gigabit Communities (SGC) Reverse Pitch Competitions –
          competitions that are focused on empowering local change
          makers to ideate and develop innovative gigabit
          applications. US Ignite is a nonprofit that spurs the
          creation of next-generation applications and services that
          leverage advanced networking technologies to build the
          foundation for smart communities. Funded by the National
          Science Foundation (NSF), US Ignite’s Smart Gigabit
          Communities program is creating “living lab” environments
          for the next generation of gigabit applications.

One challenge to accomplishing this goal is connecting homeless youth with service providers quickly and effectively. Initial web based application was developed as part of 2016 Hack-for-a-Cause, and now we want to expand its capabilities to accommodate a specific need, and to allow for future growth, particularly at a school catchment area level.",

towards becoming more accessible online. With most families looking for information on
the internet, there is a need for the interactive, friendly, and information-based website.
But we want more than a website - we want to build an interactive portal that gives our
visitors a portal into our exhibits. By building a site that harnesses the local gigabit fiber
and high-speed data transfer capabilities - users will have a say in creating and
manipulating the exhibits to their preferences - creating a customized and unique
experience for each visitor.`,

Multiple groups and organizations are floundering in an overload of disconnected information and even the best collaborations have only been able to produce small-scale solutions. The greatest obstacle is simply a lack of connection and communication among the people with the capacity to help. A well-designed web portal can become an effective social problem-solving network at scale by serving as a networking platform to share action projects that are planned, are being implemented, or have had problems.",

throughout the city that are continuing to evolve - the 20x21EUG Mural Project by City of
Eugene Cultural Service’s Public Art Program aims to create 20 or more world-class
outdoor murals in Eugene between now and the 2021 IAAF World Championships. The
problem is, tourists (and even locals) have no good centralized resource to find these
ever-expanding pieces of art. Technologists from Hack for a Cause will work to develop a
crowdsourced resource to help locals and visitors navigate these public art treasures.
The opportunity for real-time art interactivity also presents itself - with users being able to
use smart devices to not only learn more about each mural and art piece - but to use and
build emerging technologies such as augmented reality to interact and expand upon the
artwork using the high-speed downtown fiber network.`,

Technology’s Glimmer XP app is being used for the Step into [AR] Poetry in the Overpark
Garage. The augmented reality overlay allows for an interactive experience that will make
images and comics come to life, literally. It can also serve as an economic development
tool to attract new talent, new jobs, new businesses to our community because what
parking garage has augmented reality comics in its stairwells? Only in Eugene! We are
also currently in talks with local interactive arts/music/game collective Tech Tone
Graphix to develop a cross-city interactive low-latency game experience across our
various parking structures as an addendum to their Mozilla Gigabit Community Fund
grant - stay tuned!`,

Not only that, but when we throw away food, we throw away all the resources that went into growing it. While edible food is going into the trash, one in six Oregonians are food insecure. If we can find a way to capture all our wasted food, we could feed all those who are hungry in our community.
