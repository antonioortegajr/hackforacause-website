        Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
        gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability,
        physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in
        public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
        harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
        talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and
        unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any
        harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event
        organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
        warning the individual or expulsion from the event with no
        refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is
        being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a
        member of the TAO staff immediately.

        TAO staff will be happy to help participants address concerns.
        All reports will be treated as confidential. We strongly
        encourage you to address your issues privately with any of our
        staff members who are organizing the event. We encourage you to
        avoid disclosing information about the incident until the staff
        has had sufficient time in which to address the situation.
        Please also keep in mind that public shaming can be
        counterproductive to building a strong community. We do not
        condone nor participate in such actions.
